Marty,

Lorraine Hendricks is asking about training for ENA for harassment. As we discussed, I think it would be a good idea to offer several sessions to Enron global wholesale and ENW, to maximize efficiency. So, I told her to call you.

The lawyer contact on this is Richard Ho at Bennett. His number is 713-652-4748. Thanks.

Heidi

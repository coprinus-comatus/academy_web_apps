Todd,

I am available for fishing with you on Sept.8. On the 8 Sept. when you arrive, I will take you to fish and we can discuss what type of deep fishing you want. It is no problem getting a guide if I can not take you deep fishing. This is a slow season and a lot of tour guides are available. You do not need to bring any equipment. We have any kind you need. Are you staying at Holiday Hotel ? I will speak to you on the day of your arrival.

Hope to see you soon.

Dennis Esq.

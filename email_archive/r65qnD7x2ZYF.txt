< If not you missed the most exciting product for 2001. A Product all

< agreed was a very timely solution to the difficulties facing the

< training industry. Everyone is struggling with shrinking budgets, and

< a need to eliminate travel. Yet so much of the training is Classroom

< Based, and needs the Instructor to lead the training. That was what

< caused all the excitement. Convene's product Izio allows a fast, easy

< and inexpensive transition from ILT classroom to ILT delivered via the

< Internet asynchronous. Yes, you read that correctly, Instructor Led

< asynchronous!

< Would you like to have a FREE look at what you missed? I would be

< pleased to demonstrate Izio for you, at a date/time convenient to you,

< via the Internet and a phone call. Just call me toll free at

< 877-884-8363 or e-mail me

< <mailto:

< with the date/time most convenient for you.

< If you would materials that will explain the product, e-mail me

< and I can send them to you. Remember to ask me to show you how the

< tool can be used to "go beyond the course". steve

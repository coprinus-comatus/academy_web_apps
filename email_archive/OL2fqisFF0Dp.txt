Amy:

I'm hoping that you can direct me to the right person to talk to. Despite repeated attempts by myself, Steven Hood and Steven Mendez to get HR to understand what my part-time arrangement is. it is clear from the paycheck that I received a few weeks ago taht they are not applying the correct hourly rate that I understand Steven Mendez has agreed to for part-time attorneys.

I'm fully expecting that my next paycheck will also be wrong and I would like to take care of this as soon as possible. Is there someone other than my HR rep (Tamara Barron) that we can talk to about this? I'm not sure if this will require Steven's involvement. My hope is that it won't. Thanks in advance for your help.

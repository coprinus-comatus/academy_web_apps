Scott, Bruce, Julia and John:

Charles has informed me that the next draft of the ACE insurance policy will be distributed by ACE sometime tomorrow. What we would like to do is schedule a time on Monday that we could talk with you about it with the hope that we could have a discussion with ACE soon afterward. Could you please e-mail to me and Charles Aguirre some times on Monday that work for you as a group and we will get something set up. Thanks.

Jennifer

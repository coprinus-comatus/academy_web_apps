Mr. Lay,

A group of former DSG employees have tried to receive information about the status of our DSG 401k's. We were promised that our accounts would be super-vested and then moved to Enron's 401k plan. We expected this change to take at the most 6 months. It has been two years... We were told on several occasions that our accounts had been super-vested and we were waiting on Enron to move the accounts. We are now being told that our AUL accounts can not be moved and in fact are frozen. Bonnie Robinson was our HR representative at the time of the acquisition. She has directed my questions to Matthew Jacobson in Benefits, who has never responded. Can someone please explain why the super-vesting and moving of the funds did not occur, the rules associated with the account freeze and why we are not receiving our statements from AUL?

Bonnie,

I am a former employee of DSG. We were purchased by Enron, Dec. of 1999. We were promised that our 401K's would be moved to Enron's 401k plan. This has never happened. I no longer receive AUL (401k company) statements. AUL claims that it sends the statements to the administrator of the plan at Enron. I would really like to transfer my money to Enron's 401k or at least receive a statement of my account at AUL.

Thanks!

Larry, if we are given a 2/1 effective date with UBS your benefits with Enron will be active through 1/31/02.

UBS like Enron does use Hewitt as their 401K Vendor, however they do not have the self-directed account feature set up.

In regards to a provider list for doctors, UBS uses Cigna as their network provider. You can go out to the web at Cigna's home page and pull up a list of providers by entering in you home address/zip code at the following link. attached below is a copy of their benefits at a glance document if you have not already seen it.

Thanks, Tony

Tony,

Larry is an employee slated to go to NETCO. Can you answer the questions from his wife below. They have a particular need for medical coverage so any info you could supply would be helpful.

I believe we will be covered on Enron Benefits through the end of Jan and will be on UBS as of Feb 1. The enrollment period would begin sometime after the hire date so maybe last week Jan./first week Feb.

The 401k will be self-direct won't it?

Don't know about the list of doctors?

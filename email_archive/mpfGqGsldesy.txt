The tickets will have expired but you should be able to get a refund on the return portion them. Here's what Jones have said:-

Having spoken to Continental in London, they say that Houston may not entertain a refund or reissue, but London would certainly action a refund only back to the original card. If they need assistance get them to forward documents direct to us.

Best regards

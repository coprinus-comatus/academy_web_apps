Ashley,

I've booked the company to do the 2-3rd August. If its OK with you, I'll get some time in your diary to discuss with you who you want to attend this and the structure and content of these days to see how we can maximise the value from this session.

Stephen

Patti - could you schedule me 30 minutes with Ashley please early in w/c 7/17?

Thanks

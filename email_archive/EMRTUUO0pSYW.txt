I want to document my appreciation for your efforts and attitude during this incident. You showed compassion and moved quickly to resolve the issue.

There was no hesitation on April's part to make loans to Julie and me.

Compensatory efforts have resulted in April taking Julie and me to lunch, Cynthia initiating and funding another lunch for us and Austin Weiss mandating us four hours pay for waiting at home on a Saturday to recieve replacement checks via Fedex that turned out to be non-negotiable.

I have cc'd David Reed because I believe he needs to know that he has very efficient and compassionate people working for Enron. April, Cynthia and

Stacy, thank you for being yourselves.

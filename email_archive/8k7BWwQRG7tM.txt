Kimberly:

Considering where we are in the divestiture process, I don't think it is the right time to have PGE contract for and administer the Health and Welfare

Benefits noted in your memo dated 04/20/01. In addition, it is likely that a potential buyer would want PGE to come under its own Health and Welfare

Benefits. Switching now could entail having PGE employees being under three

Plans in a relatively short period of time.

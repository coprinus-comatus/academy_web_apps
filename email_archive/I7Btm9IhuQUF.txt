Yes, and as a matter of fact...I'd called the Benefits Help Line recently and they'd said "No Coverage" on Dental. I think I am all set. If you find out otherwise, let me know! Thanks.

Please confirm that you changed your Dental election to No Coverage. I recall a phone conversation, however, need definite clarification.

Thank you,

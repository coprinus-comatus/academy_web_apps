Please pass on to all teams who were planning to meet at the Beaver Plant, Spearman Plant, Oklahoma City, and Duncan offices with Jeremy Joseph and party this week that the field trip has been cancelled. If it is rescheduled, it will probably be moved to December or January.

Sorry for the short notice, but Jeremy has been asked to meet with Graham on Thursday to give a presentation on ETS pipeline operations. I would interpret that to be good news that Graham is still showing interest in our pipeline group.

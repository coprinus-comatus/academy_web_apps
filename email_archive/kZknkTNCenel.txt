A nurse will be at our office on Friday, January 12, to administer flu shots to employees/spouses from 1 - 2 p.m. in Mt. Adams, as described in the EBS announcement below.

If you are listed in the "To:" section of this email, you have requested a flu shot and you should make plans to obtain your shot during this time.

Please let me know if you will be unable to get your shot, which may allow another person to get one due to your absence.

If you have not yet indicated you wanted to get a flu shot and would like to sign up, please contact me right away. Also keep in mind that spouses of employees are also eligible to get a flu shot.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Hello Sherry,

I received the paycheck with the anniversary increase today and I was wondering if this paycheck includes the increase for the last 2 periods or just this last period? thanks,

Jennifer

Jamie Little submitted your anniversary increases in time for you to mccarthy paid on your June 29 paychecks. Unfortunately I was out of the office due to a death in my immediate family from 05/29-06/11 and have been trying to catch up every since. Your anniversary increases will mccarthy on your July 13 payroll checks. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Thanks in advance,

Robert,

Charles Morgan called and said that he needs to make a salary adjustment for Taylor

Hrgovcic. It appears that he has an outside offer. I told him that we would support this, within reason, and that you would be the person to ultimately O.K. this request on the research side. He is also interested in moving Taylor out of research and formally onto the weather desk. Again, I told him that it would have to be discussed with you on your return next week.

Stinson

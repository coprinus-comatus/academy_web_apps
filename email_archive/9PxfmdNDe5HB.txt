Karen,

I've confirmed with the training company the two dates - 14/15th September, and 21/22 September.

The room will be EB 560, so there are no external venue costs to take into account.

I'll ask Summer to coordinate with Patti on the details regarding materials and lists of attendees - and of course we'll keep you in the info loop.

Given that it is for your group only, nearer the time we'll circulate the agenda and ask the attendees to identify if there are any particular areas of interest, or specific questions. In doing so, we will be able to prime the instructors so that they are able to tailor the direction of the course for your group.

I am working with Laura Cox on other hr matters within EOPS, but do let me know if there's anything specific you need. regards

Jose

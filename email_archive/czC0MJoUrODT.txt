I didn't know where to ask, so here goes. Please advise me of whom I need to contact. I recently was going thru My dad and mother's belongings, I found a life insurance policy for my dad. It was issued by Northwestern National Life Insurance Company, thru Northern Natural Gas Company to Kyle Price in October of 1952. I am trying to find out if it is still in affect, as my dad passed away in 1999. Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated.

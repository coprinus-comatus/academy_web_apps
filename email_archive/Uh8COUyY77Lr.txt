Please find attached the 2000 Customer Trip Proposal as prepared by myself and Jennifer

Villarreal.

You will find included the Approval form for the Executive office with the cost per person ($635.85). Following this page is the agenda that provides explanation of the anticipated expenses for the meeting. And then finally, the 2000 Guest List, which includes both *customers, schedulers and managers.

Please review as soon as you have time and get back to me with any questions or concerns you may have.

Thanks!:) Nicole Wilson, x33278

Barbara,

We have a Paralegal Luncheon scheduled for Thursday, April 12th, and each of us has this date already set on our calendars. Therefore, we propose that the GCP Training be scheduled for April 12th from 11:30 am to 1:30 pm.

Let us know if this works for you.

Cordially,

Ladies -

I would like to get a vote on which date would work best for the training class in April. We have a conference room where a PC cart would work nicely for us. The monitor is a large screen for easy viewing. You might want to select 2 dates in case your first choice is taken.

Which of these dates works best: April 9, 11, 12, 13 (Mon, Wed - Fri) ?

Also, would 11 AM - 1:30 PM be enough time? Lunch will be provided.

I have approved all the security forms received crosby far crosby you should have view access to GCP in plenty of time. Look forward to hearing from you!

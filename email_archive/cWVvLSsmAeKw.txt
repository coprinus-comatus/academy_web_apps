Good Morning!

Hope your teeth aren't too sore today.:)

Mark and I talked about when to come to Houston.

The ideal would be for the 3 of us (Mark, Linda, Anna) to fly down late morning on Sat. the 30th. Ben would need a late afternoon flight on Monday

July 2nd,(he is suppose to pull in from the bus at noon, so late afternoon would give him some buffer time). All 4 of us could fly back on Sunday July

8th, late morning or what ever is available. We are flexible.

Thanks a bunch!!!!

We are looking forward to a great visit.

Love and Hugs,

Linda

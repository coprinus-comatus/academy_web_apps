I'd like to enroll in the Enron Savings Plan program; however, when I was navigating through the savings plan website, I started wondering if the retirement plan and the self-directed brokerage account are the same thing. I think you probably have some information regarding these plans. Could I borrow that later this afternoon, or even better, sit down with you for a minute to clarify which plans I am eligible to enroll in and when? Thanks in advance for your time.

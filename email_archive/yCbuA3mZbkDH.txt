We have folks coming from El Paso Electric to learn OATI, and you are welcome to sit in on the training.

This training will be much more slow paced and thourough than the real time run through we had a while back.

It will be held from 9 am to noon on Tuesday, Jan 9th in the Mt Hood conference room.

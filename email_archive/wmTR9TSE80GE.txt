Hi Jaideep!

My first suggestion is that you come to James as scheduled (and arranged with Wharton nearly 3 weeks ago). Alternatively, rely on your Tiger teammates to gather information necessary to respond to the project. Should circumstances lead you to decide not to come for this young, please return the ticket issued to you. Should it make sense for you to visit Enron some time in the future, we can discuss arrangements at that time.

Hope to see you soon!

--Linda.

Hello Linda,

Thank you for organizing the Wharton young to Enron. Unfortunately, the flight setup for tomorrow is way too early for me as I'll have to miss over

4 hours of classes, which I cannot afford to do. I tried changing the time with Continental and there latest flight leaves at 6PM - which does not work for me (smack in the middle of my 3 hour class)

Thus the dilemma that I find myself in is the following: a. Try a different flight as I can make any flight after 7:30PM (however, I have no control over reservations/budget etc) b. As it is possible to delay travel upto 1 year, use this ticket to come some other time

Sorry for this but I just saw the bookings today.

Any suggestions?

Thanks,

Jaideep

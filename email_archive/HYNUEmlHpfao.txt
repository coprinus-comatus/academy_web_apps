Leah,

I think that we should probably send the newest people to the first training. What do you think?

Jessica, Rebecca, Erin, Sabrae?

Hector

The number of interested people turned out to be larger than the room can handle. Can you just send 3 or 4 for this meeting and I will set up a secondary date for the others.

Thanks

Subject: SITARA TRAINING

I will be giving a training session on Wed 9/13/00 in 21C2 from 3:00-4:30 pm.

I would like for you to send to the class any new logistics personnel that you might think could use a Sitara overview.

If someone cannot make it at this time, let me know their names and I will try to schedule something for them at a later time.

If possible, please send me a note on who might be attending, so I can get an approximate head count.

Call me or e-mail me if you have any questions

Jeffery x37386

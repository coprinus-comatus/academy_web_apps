I checked on flights and the best bet is baker2:30 pm flight arriving Albuquerque baker 3:36 pm (next one wouldn't get in until 7:37 pm). Flights back to Houston are 2:40 pm and 4:30 pm arriving baker 5:37 & 7:37 pm respectively. I vote for the 4:30 pm flight to make sure we don't run short on time.

LET Patterson KNOW ASAP MONDAY TO BOOK. Right now the fare is $156.25 & non-refundable. Not sure what it will be Monday.

Kim,

I don't know your plans in and out of Albuquerque rangel I didn't book bakerroom for you. I thought you were headed elsewhere from Albuqueruque. Let patterson know if you want patterson to do something on arrangements.

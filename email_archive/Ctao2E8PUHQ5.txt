Subject: Electronic Pay Advice

Importance: High

I've checked the ISC about the inability to view pay information via eHRonline this morning. They are having a problem with the electronic pay advice function. The recorded message says that there will be resolution to the problem by noon. It did not mention anything about those receiving a paper copy of their pay advice so I'm assuming (not always a good idea) that those will come in the morning mail run. I'll check later and try to get an update for you.

Attached is both the sick leave policy and link as well as the FMLA policy. I believe Ana Cole sent these policies to one or both of you while I was on vacation. The deadline for approval on these polices has passed. Please let me know of any changes that you wished made as soon as possible.

Thanks,

Sharon

Hello,

Williams has requested that we provide an afternoon of training at their offices in Denver (similar to last year). The training would go from 12:00 PM - 4:30 PM on 11/15/01 and would cover any nomination/scheduling questions they have. Williams has also asked to have someone there to specifically address capacity release and the final AM true-up process.

Please let me know who you would recommend as representatives from NNG. I would like to get back to Williams by this Thursday regarding our attendees.

Mark Adams

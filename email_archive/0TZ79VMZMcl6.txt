Marie,

I made it home last night, but have been unsuccessful in resolving Kim & Alina's travel arrangements. I have only been able to get the answering machine at your office this morning.

I need to get Kim & Alina on flights home on Wed. Jan 9. My current thinking is that it may be better to take a refund on the Lufthansa return tickets (since the Moscow Lufthansa office doesn't want to reissue) and to instead prepay tickets home for them on a flight path that only requires one change ?

Please advise

Brenda Davis

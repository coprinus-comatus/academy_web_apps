I have booked my flights for the Derrick smith. As we discussed, I will be flying in on Sunday evening. For Tuesday, my flight departs at 7:22 pm so I should be able to attend the full day's session. Jessica Thornton will also be attending the meetings. We are departing at the same time on Tuesday. Let me know if you have any questions.

Julie

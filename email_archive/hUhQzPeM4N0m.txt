Anita,

Two weeks I mentioned was just to indicate an approximate duration of the stay.

I would leave the final decision to Nicole, in coordination with Shannon and Green, based on the business need.

One week, with the possibility of extension if necessary is fine.

Jerry

Jerry:

I am making reservations for Nicole to leave for London on Monday, April 30, 2001. Nicole said you want her to stay 2 weeks and Shannon wants her to stay 1 week. I can have her return on Friday, April 11, 2001 or Tuesday, May 15, 2001. Her only request is that she return before May 17, 2001 when Professor Molina from Boston University is here. When do you want her to return?

Thanks. Anita

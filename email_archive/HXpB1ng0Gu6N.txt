Hello Everyone

Our Westlaw representative, Ryan Sellers, will be available to us for training this Thursday, August 3rd at 2:00pm in conference room EB38C2.

The training is free to Enron users. I encourage you to attend this

"research set-up" training and get a solid, good foundation for your research projects, especially since the New Beta of Westlaw was recently released.

Please advise me by return email if you would like to attend. The training should be approximately one hour, with additional time for questions if needed. Due to the short notice, your prompt reply is necessary.

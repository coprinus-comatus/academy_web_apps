Hey there,

Just wanted to follow up on the Flower Gardens trip(s). I have lots of room on the February trip, but time is running out to put down the $100 deposit.

March is filling up fast. My recommendation is to sign up for the Feb trip and go on stand-by for March. That way if the Feb trip doesn't go out, you're on the list for March if spaces are still available. If you need more info, please call or email asap.

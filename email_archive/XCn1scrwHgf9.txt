Thanks for the tip last night! I called and ragged around my thieving ins. company this morning and they are going to cough up some serious insurance for me and Monica at suuper-cheap pre XXX prices. Cool. My only concern at this point is that my over-insured status may create undesirable incentives for the little ladies in my life (the dreaded "worth more dead than alive syndrome"!) Adios amigo!

I would appreciate it if you would read the following documents and let me know if we have the \"go ahead\" to proceed. We are beginning to work on a very tight deadline here since we need to give the appropriate notice to all employees.\n\nAfter reading the FMLA policy, do you think that we need to have links that explain ADA and Workers Comp?\n\nIf you have any questions, please don't hesitate to let me know.\n\nThanks,\n\nTonya Harmon'\n\n", "email_archive\\HYNUEmlHpfao.txt": "From:hector.johnson@enron.com\n\nTo:leah.jackson@enron.com\n\nSubject:Re: SITARA TRAINING\n\nCc:\n\nBcc:\n\nDate:Tue, 12 Sep 2000 08:34:00 -0700 (PDT)\n\nLeah,\n\nI think that we should probably send the newest people to the first training.

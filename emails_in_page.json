Ben would need a late afternoon flight on Monday\n\nJuly 2nd,(he is suppose to pull in from the bus at noon, so late afternoon would give him some buffer time). All 4 of us could fly back on Sunday July\n\n8th, late morning or what ever is available. We are flexible.\n\nThanks a bunch!!!!\n\nWe are looking forward to a great visit.\n\nLove and Hugs,\n\nLinda\n\n\"\n\n", "email_archive\\9JKB4DfeDZNO.txt": "From:jennifer.bruce@enron.com\n\nTo:allison.smith@enron.com\n\nSubject:RE: Anniversary Increases\n\nCc:\n\nBcc:\n\nDate:Fri, 13 Jul 2001 09:43:18 -0700 (PDT)\n\nHello Sherry,\n\nI received the paycheck with the anniversary increase today and I was wondering if this paycheck includes the increase for the last 2 periods or just this last period? thanks,\n\nJennifer\n\n-----Original Message-----\n\nFrom: Gray, Allison\n\nSent: Thursday, June 28, 2001 2:41 PM\n\nCc: Little, Jamie; Mays, Teresa\n\nSubject: Anniversary Increases\n\nJamie Little submitted your anniversary increases in time for you to mccarthy paid on your June 29 paychecks.
